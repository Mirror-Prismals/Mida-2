# Frog Level
i made a agi puzzle game, its called frog level



level 1:

reach the goal
```mida
[S][=][=][=][G]
```
tell the path you have to take, levels will get more harder



level 2:

reach the goal
```mida
[S][=]

[||]

[||]

[G]
```


level 3:

reach the goal
```mida
[r][=][=][S][=][=][q]

[||]

[||]

[G]
```


correct!

level 4
```mida
[S][T][=][T]

[=][||][=][||]

[||][||][=][||]

[||][p][=][G]
```


p can be entered from the top or bottom and right, then it switches to a q, after which it cannot be exited from the right, only left, and vice versa for q becomes p, its a fun mechanic
